World Weaver Chronicles
=======

In a world where spells are downloaded like apps, can Nayt and Fiona outsmart an oppressive priesthood and live to unlock their full powers?

To any primitive culture, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. Nayt is an apprentice Weaver and learns hidden techniques to build and create objects much more powerful than any his medieval town has ever seen. Fiona is a hunter and stumbles across a secret cave that contains dark and dangerous magics powered by ancient robots. Together with their muscular friend Peder, they begin an epic journey full of swords and lasers that will rebuild the fate of their town, their families, and their entire world.

Book 1: Weaver's Launch
=======
The first book of the series, Weaver's Launch, starts off as a classic Fantasy adventure novel that grows into a Science Fiction story of awakening and teenage growth. In a far-future world that has no metal, technology is banned by an oppressive priesthood. People that discover how to use their genetically enhanced augmented reality technologies are shunned as demon worshippers. Magic exists in many forms: apps that can be downloaded to give you advanced powers, tools that can be fabricated, and the most powerful - information available at the speed of thought. The entire story could be summed up with one question: If I was a farmboy from the 8th century, what would happen if I had full access to the modern Internet?
