Dedication

This book is dedicated to my son Julian, my mother Barbara, my wife Jacqueline, and my sister Jaime. 

Julian: Most of the ideas from this book came to me while singing Julian to sleep or telling him bedtime stories. We are so proud of you, son.

Barbara: You taught me to love to read from an early age and always encouraged me in everything I did. Thank you.

Jacqueline: Love you, shatz.

Jaime: Your strength and perseverance are a constant motivation. 

Special thanks also go out to my friends who encouraged me and helped me think through concepts while providing valuable feedback.
